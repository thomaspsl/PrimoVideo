## 📚 Description
The project consists in the creation of a new ios mobile application where you'll find visuals similar to an already existing "Prime Video" application. In this application, you'll find the use of an MVC framework using the SwiftUI library. Among the features available, the application uses the well-known MovieDB movie management API. Thanks to this API, it's possible to see the list of the most popular films of the moment, as well as those with the highest ratings. It is also able to list the different categories of films that exist, and to take note of the films that belong to these categories. I hope this application meets your needs!
